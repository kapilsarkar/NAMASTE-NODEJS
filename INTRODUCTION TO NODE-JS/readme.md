## INTRODUCTION TO NODE JS

### 1. What is `Node-JS` ?

  - `Node JS` is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

  -  In other words `Node -JS` is built on top of "Chrome V8 Java Script Engine" which is known for high     performance and efficient execution of JS Code 

  - `Node JS`  is cross platform means it can run on windows,linux and also on other platforms.

  - `Node JS` is Open source and it is maintained by Open JS Foundation.

  - `Node JS` executes Java Script outside the web browser.

 ### 2. Is `Node JS` is related to `Event driven architecture` ?

  - Yes Node-JS operates on event driven architecture means it can handle asynchronous operation.

 ### 3. What is Async I/O ?
 - `Node-JS` can handle `asynchronous` operation. `Async I/0` also known as `Non-Blocking I/O`

 - In other words it can perform `input/output` tasks `without blocking` other operations.

 ### 4. History of `Node -JS` ?

 - `Node-JS` was developed ny `Ryan Dahl` in 2009.

 - `Node-JS` runs Java script code and to run Java script code we need a `Javascript-Engine` whether it's in a browser like Chrome  or a server Environment or in other words wherever there is Java Script there is a  `JavScript-Engine`.

 - Initially `Ryan Dahl`  worked with `Spider Monkey` which itself is a Java script Engine but switched in 2 days to the V8 Engine to Google Chrome due to it's performance. Now V8 engine powers Node-JS.

 - Initially while developing `Node-JS` by `Ryan Dahl` and named it as `Web JS` for building Web Server but later after realizing it's potential and named `Node-JS`.

 - `Ryan Dahl` developed `Node-JS` independently but a company named `Joyent` shown interested in `Node-JS`.

 ### 5. `Node-JS`  vs `Apache HTTP` Server ?

 - Initially `Apache` was used to create `HTTP` server and it's a `blocking` server and `Ryan Dahl` wanted to build a non-blocking server.

 - In other words before `Node -JS`, the `Apache` `HTTP` Server was widely used but had `blocking I/O`, meaning it could handle fewer concurrent requests.

 - The primary advantage of `Non-Blocking` is it can handle multiple requests with lesser number of `threads`.

 ### 6. What is `NPM` ?

 - `NPM` is a package manager for `Node-JS` it came in `2010`.

 
 - `NPM` is basically a resistor or a central place where we can add new packages and packages can be of anything example if we want to handle time,date,images etc there are separate packages for it.

 -  `NPM` was developed by `Joyent` in 2010 initially available for `Mac-OS` and `Linux`.

 - In `2011` `Windows` support came up and it was led by `Joyent` and `Microsoft`, then windows support for `Node-JS` was build.

 - In `2012`, `Ryan Dahl` stepped down from managing `Node.JS`, and `Isaac Z. Schlueter`, creator `NPM`, took over. 

 ### 7. How `Node-JS` was forked and merged ?

 - In `2014`, a developer named `Fedor Indutny` forked `Node.JS`, creating `IO.JS`, due to disagreements within the community.

 - `IO.JS` and `Node-JS` merged back together in `2015` and they maintained `Node-JS`.

 - In `2019` two major communities, the `JS-Foundation` and `Node-JS` foundation `merged` to form the `Open-JS Foundation`.

 ### In `2024` `Node-JS` continues to be widely used.
