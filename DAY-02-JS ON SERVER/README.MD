### JS ON SERVER 

### What is a Server ?

- It  is a type of system that handles requests from clients and provides services, data, or resources over a network.

- `Example :` web server like Apache which hosts websites and serves web pages to user's browsers when they request them via the internet.

### What it means when we say we are running a website on server ?

- Tt means that the website's files, such as HTML, CSS, images, and scripts, are hosted on a server, which responds to requests from users' browsers by delivering the website's content over the internet. The server processes these requests, allowing the website to be accessible to users online.

- In other words it is one CPU  or a machine which is receiving the requests and processes these requests.


### Relation of Java Script ans Server 

- Initially Java Script was the only language which was used inside the browser but after Node-JS we can run Java Script on the server.

- Now Java Script coming on the server as well as the web it gave us an opportunity for a single developer to develop Full Stack Applications.

- Java Script engineers can now code using libraries and frameworks like React and Angular on the client side and using Node-Js on the server side.
