### JS ON SERVER 

### What is a `Server` ?

- It  is a type of system that handles requests from clients and provides services, data, or resources over a network.

- `Example :` web server like `Apache` which hosts websites and serves web pages to user's browsers when they request them via the internet.

### What it means when we say we are running a website on server ?

- Tt means that the website's files, such as HTML, CSS, images, and scripts, are hosted on a server, which responds to requests from users' browsers by delivering the website's content over the internet. The server processes these requests, allowing the website to be accessible to users online.

- In other words it is one CPU  or a machine which is receiving the requests and processes these requests.


### Relation of Java Script and `Server` 

- Initially Java Script was the only language which was used inside the browser but after `Node-JS` we can run Java Script on the server.

- Now Java Script coming on the server as well as the web it gave us an opportunity for a single developer to develop Full Stack Applications.

- Java Script engineers can now code using `libraries` and `frameworks` like `React` and `Angular` on the client side and using Node-Js on the server side.

### Does `Node-JS` has `C++` code ?

- Yes `Node-JS` includes `C++` code. `Node-JS` is built on top of the `V8` Java Script engine which is written in C++.

- `Node.JS` uses `C++` for certain performance-critical parts of its runtime.

### What is V8 Java Script engine ?

- The `V8` engine is an open-source Java Script engine developed by `Google`, primarily used in the `Chrome` browser and Node-JS to execute Java Script code. In other words `V8` is `Google's ` open source high performance Java Script and web assembly engine written in C++. 

- `V8`  is written in C++. The Java Script Engine uses C++ to execute Java Script Code. 72% majority of the code of V8 is written in C++.

- The Job of `V8` Engine is to execute Java Script Code.

- `V8` can be embedded into any C++ application.

- We write Java Script code then it is being read by `V8 ` which is written in `C++` converts the code in which machine understands.

- `V8` engine follows `ECMA` Script standards.

### What is ECMA Script ?

- It is standard for Scripting language including Java Script, JS script and Action Script.

- All JS engine must follow ECMA Script.


### Does `Node JS` has V8 `embedded` on it ?

- Yes, `Node.JS` has the `V8` JavaScript engine embedded within it. 

- When we install `Node.JS`, the `V8` engine comes bundled with it. This means that when we run a `Node-JS` application, our JavaScript code is executed directly by the `V8` engine.


### When V8 executes any piece of Java Script code why was there need of Node-JS ?

- `V8` is the engine that executes Java Script code, `Node-JS` provides the runtime environment for the use JavaScript for server-side development.

- `Node JS` has V8 engine plus it has a lot more super powers.

- `Node-JS` essentially empowers Java Script to be used as a general-purpose programming language outside of the browser.

- `Node-JS` as a C++ program it has `V8` embedded in it and along with that there are more super powers which it gives and when it runs on the server makes it very powerful.

### What are these super powers of Node-JS ?

- This can be explained by example , suppose if we have a data base  installed and if we want to connect to the data base through Java Script or let us take another example if we want to make `HTTP` call then these super powers comes inform of `api` and that is the core thing that `Node-JS` adds onto V8.

- `Node-JS` with these super powers on top of V8 and this si known as Java Script runtime.

- `Node-JS` : Java Script (62%) + C++(21%).


### Java Script run time ?

- A Java Script runtime is an environment that allows Java Script code to be executed.It includes `JavaScript Engine`, `APIs` , `Event Loop:` and `Call Stack`.

- In other words a Java Script runtime provides everything needed to execute Java Script code and interact with the environment in which it runs, whether that's a `browser (like Chrome)` or a `server (like Node.js)`.

### Is `V8` written in `C++` ?

- Yes, `V8` is written in `C++`. The `V8` Java Script engine is a high-performance engine developed by `Google`, and itâ€™s primarily written in `C++` 

- Computers only understands Binary Code. On top Binary code there is Assembly code and on top of Assembly code there is High level language. C++ is a high level language.

- These C++ code or the Java Script engine takes our Java Script  converts it into a machine code and machine code converts it to a low level code. Machine Code + Assembly Code is known as low level code.

- The code that we write in the higher languages and we need a C++ program or something like a JS Engine that converts our high level code to machine understandable code, which is the job of JS Engine.

- In other words, `V8` is a `C++` based engine designed to execute Java Script code efficiently by compiling it to machine code.
